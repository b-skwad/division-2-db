# Future Home of The Division 2 - Item database

We have decided to put together a website that will allow folks to view information about the armour, weapons, talents, mods, and gear attributes of items in [The Division 2](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/the-division/the-division-2).  We started discussing this project as something to do whilst the servers were down because of the Year 5 Season 1 update.

Special thanks to the [Ahmed](https://discordapp.com/users/Ahmad#0001) and [Ruben](https://discordapp.com/users/rubenalamina) that have worked upon this [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTJEX5DerCvOj3a_m36TRy1gPBAUvrduOIdmXI9j1Y0MpQk1wIXaZ9KOcPa7HzXzp_N5qGmjDj6yEfL/pubhtml#), you inspired us to do this. Our mini-project would not be possible without your efforts! Thanks a million!
